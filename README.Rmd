# Question 1

## Code

```{r}
gc() 

library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse, lubridate)

list.files('Question1/Code', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))
```

## Loading Data

```{r}
 library(readr)
 Deaths_by_cause <- read_csv("Question1/Data/Covid/Deaths_by_cause.csv")

```

```{r}
library(readr)
owid_covid_data <- read_csv("Question1/Data/Covid/owid-covid-data.csv")

```

## Graph 1.1

```{r}
g <- line_graph_continents(owid_covid_data)

```

As seen in the graph, the continents with the highest number of total cases is Europe and North America. African countries are seen to have not been as greatly by COVID than North American, South American and European countries. In comparison, the number of total countries in Africa seem almost insignificant in comparison to countries in other continents.

However, to accurately interpret this graph, it is imperative that one take in to consideration the population of the continents.

## Graph 1.2

```{r}
g <- brics_SI_deaths(owid_covid_data)

```
A seen in the figure above, BRICS countries are compared. When investigating the stringency index of these countries, it is evident that a stronger stringency index is positively correlated to total cases of each country. 

# Question 2

## Code

```{r}
gc() 

library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse, lubridate)

list.files('Question2/Code', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))
```

## Loading Data

```{r}
library(readr)
london_weather <- read_csv("Question2/Data/London/london_weather.csv")

```

```{r}
library(readr)
SUN_Hours <- read_csv("~/Desktop/20945043/Question2/Data/SUN Hours.csv")
```

## Graph 2.1

```{r}
g <- london_code(london_weather)
```

As seen in the graph above, there is a positive correlation between the maximum temperature and the amount of sun. However, this positive correlation is not very steep, indicating that a jump in the amount of sun only results in a small jump in the max temperature. 

## Graph 2.2

```{r}
g <- lond_c(london_weather, SUN_Hours)
```
As depicted in the bar graph above, when compared, Stellenbosch winters are much warmer than London winters. And London summers are much cooler than Stellenbosch summers.

These two graphs suggest that moving to London is a bad idea. 

# Question 4

## Code

```{r}
gc() 

library(pacman)
p_load(tidyverse, lubridate)

list.files('Question4/Code', full.names = T, recursive = T) %>% as.list() %>% walk(~source(.))
```

## Loading Data

```{r}
library(readr)
credits <- read_csv("~/Desktop/20945043/Question4/Data/netflix/credits.csv")
```

```{r}
library(readr)
titles <- read_csv("~/Desktop/20945043/Question4/Data/netflix/titles.csv")
```

## Graphs and Statistics

```{r}
g <- netflix_code(titles)
```

## Figure 4.1

|            | Movies   | Shows    |
|------------|----------|----------|
| IMDb score | 6.266980 | 7.017377 |

: IMDb Score: Movies vs Shows

According to the data, shows did better than movies. 

According to the accompanying data, the combination ['scifi', 'family', 'fantasy', 'animation', 'action'] genre is most enjoyed out of all genre combinations, with an average IMDb score of 9.3.
